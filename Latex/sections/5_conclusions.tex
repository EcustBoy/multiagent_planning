\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper formulated a DMPC algorithm for fast multiagent point-to-point trajectory generation. By equipping the agents with a prediction horizon, they are able to predict and avoid future collisions while moving to their waypoints.  The parallel execution in DMPC is a more cooperative paradigm than sequentially greedy algorithms such as dec-iSCP, which results in a higher probability of success, specially in volumes with high density of agents. DMPC scales linearly with the number of agents, drastically reducing computation time with respect to dec-iSCP. More importantly, the runtime of DMPC is less sensitive to the complexity of the transition than the runtime of dec-iSCP. The proposed algorithm is then a highly scalable multiagent trajectory generator, well-suited for multi-robot applications.
