\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper formulated a DMPC algorithm for fast multiagent point-to-point trajectory generation. By equipping the agents with a prediction horizon, they are able to predict and avoid future collisions. An intuitive heuristic was introduced to enhance the probability of finding feasible solutions, an increasing the usefulness of the algorithm.  The parallel execution is a more cooperative paradigm than sequential algorithms such as dec-iSCP, which results in higher probability of success, specially in volumes with high density of agents. The algorithm scales linearly with the number of agents, and it is only slightly dependent on the difficulty of the task. Further reduction in computation time could be achieved by a true parallel implementation of the algorithm (e.g. multithreading in C++), making it a good option for real-time experiments with robots.
