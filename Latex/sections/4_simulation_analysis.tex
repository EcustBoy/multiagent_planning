\section{Main Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, simulation analysis of the DMPC algorithm is provided. All the algorithms were implemented in MATLAB2017A and executed on a PC with an Intel Xeon CPU and 16GB of RAM. Table 1 shows the simulation parameters.

\subsection{Four corner exchange}
To illustrate how DMPC is able to manage colliding trajectories.
